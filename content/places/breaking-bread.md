I watched a TV show as a kid that featured a monk happily making bread, folding and kneading away in his black robe, and I've been on a quest to make good bread myself ever since. That quest involved a lot of reading and failed attempts at home before I finally sought the help of professionals.

With a lot of classes I've tried, I managed to make an OK loaf on the day, but then failed when trying to follow the whole process at home. Not so with [e5 bakehouse's class] (http://e5bakehouse.com/classes/bread/). I learned their method and came away with the skills to recreate excellent sourdough bread at home. A dozen or so homemade loaves later, I'm able to make good bread myself and I've got the knowledge base and confidence to work, happily, on improving it.
