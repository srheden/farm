While at university in 2012, my friend Daniella and I started a blog called [Shitty Photos of OK Food] (https://shittyphotosokfood.wordpress.com/). There's a lot that makes me smile on there, but it's the documented experience of cooking regularly [and sometimes competitively] (https://shittyphotosokfood.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/battle-lemon-cake/) with a great friend that I'm especially glad to have.

Chocolate beetroot cake [really] (https://shittyphotosokfood.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/man-alive-i-just-made-this-beetroot-popyseed/) [caught] (https://shittyphotosokfood.wordpress.com/2012/02/09/all-right-this-might-look-slightly-familiar-its/)  [my] (https://shittyphotosokfood.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/shitty-video-hard-to-beet/) [attention] (https://shittyphotosokfood.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/best-beet-cake/) that year, and has done ever since. If you don't know, let me tell you: chocolate and beets combined are delicious. I found my current favourite recipe for chocolate beetroot cake after trying a mini version at [Violet] (http://www.violetcakes.com/), Claire Ptak's beautiful London bakery. I've never seen the cakes there since, but I loved them so much that I searched online for the recipe right away. I dug deep and found what I'm pretty sure is it on the [Opening Ceremony blog] (http://blog.openingceremony.com/entry.asp?pid=9465).

Every time I decide to make the recipe, the blog post is increasingly more challenging to find so I'm putting a version of the recipe here for safekeeping. At the time of writing, I've made this recipe five times; it's super-rich and chocolatey and goes best with something tart like raspberries and/or crème fraîche.

Ingredients:

* 200g cooked and peeled beetroot
* 200g unsalted butter
* 200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids), broken into pieces
* 4 eggs
* 200g caster sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 200g ground almonds
* Raspberries or crème fraîche to serve (optional)

Method:

1. Butter and line a 20cm (8in) spring form cake tin.
2. Heat the oven to 170°C/338°F/gas mark 3.
3. Using a food processor, purée the beetroot until smooth. Leave in the processor.
4. Simmer some water in a saucepan. Put a large heat-proof bowl over the saucepan. Place the butter and chocolate in the bowl. Only when the butter and chocolate have nearly completely melted should you stir them to combine. Add the chocolate and butter to the blended beetroot. Don't put the bowl in the sink! Save it to use for combining the final cake batter.
5. Separate the eggs, putting the whites into clean large bowl with caster sugar and salt. Set this aside. To the slightly cooled chocolate, butter, and beetroot mixture, add the yolks and blend. Add the ground almonds and blend again. Decant into the large bowl you used for melting the chocolate and butter together.
6. Whisk the egg white mixture into stiff peaks.
7. Fold the stiff whites into the the chocolate-beetroot mixture. Spoon this batter into your prepared tin. Bake for 45-50 minutes until set but still wobbly. Allow to cool before serving.
