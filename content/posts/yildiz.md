I'd never seen a store like Yildiz until I moved to London. You pass by piles of flat peaches, pomegranates, crook cucumbers, and cantaloupes — and before you know it you find yourself pulled into the the shop and surrounded by mountains of grains, dozens of types of halva, and fresh olives, cheese, nuts, and bread. On the topic of bread, a lot of Yildiz's comes from their bakery next door, a bakery where you can get the finest gözleme in London for £2.50.

When I lived in Archway, I often stopped into Yildiz after work to pick up ingredients for a fast salad — the aforementioned crook cucumbers and flat peaches with some lemon, sumac, and toasted pistachios — to have alongside a spinach and cheese gözleme. Those were golden times.
