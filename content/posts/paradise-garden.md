Hakan Aktaş’s smile and the fruit and vegetables he picks up five nights a week from New Spitalfields Market are what keep people shopping at his greengrocers, Paradise Garden. There’s a Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local across the street, and yet Paradise Garden persists and has done so for six years now.

Hakan comes from Karahasanuşağı Köyü, a predominantly Kurdish community in Elbistan, Turkey. A river cuts through the eastern side of Karahasanuşağı Köyü, a valley town with a small forest and some agricultural land and mountains in the distance. Hakan knows the mountains well; the memories of chest-high snow and hot nights spent sleeping outside with his flock of 200 sheep are still fresh in his mind, even after ten years of living in London.

In 2007, Hakan left his shepherd’s life behind. He followed his brother to London, believing he would, like his brother, be able to make a good life for himself here. So, Hakan found work at an off licence and kept on the lookout for opportunities to start a place of his own. Paradise Gardens needed a new owner in 2011 and found one in Hakan. He transformed the interior, moved the fruit and veg front and centre, and has been there every day since – except for a holiday to Turkey here and there.

Hakan likes London. He likes his customers, his friends and family here, and the opportunities the city has given him for earning and saving money, but it’s not Karahasanuşağı Köyü. Once Hakan has saved enough to build a house and buy 100 sheep, a more modest flock this time, he will return home. Until then you’ll find him at Paradise Gardens, as he always is, about to break into laughter.
