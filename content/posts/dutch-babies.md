January and February are hard months for me, and probably for some of you too. My father died last May. This fact has been making difficult experiences I'd normally find easy and making harder those which I'd have found hard at any point in my life.

So, it's a time of sadness and here's what I'm doing all the same:

* walking and generally exercising as much as I can;
* talking to people I love;
* thinking about all I have to be grateful for; and
* making what feels good to eat.

On the last topic - what feels good to eat - Dutch babies with lemon juice and sugar have to be close to the top of the list. My momma made them for us as kids and I have to ask her to send me a picture of her recipe every couple of years. Here's the recipe written out. Now's the time to make them.

Ingredients:

* 1/4 cup or 60 grams butter
* 3 eggs
* 3/4 cup or 175 ml milk
* 3/4 cup or 90 grams flour
* lemon wedges and sugar to serve

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 220C / 200C fan / gas mark 7 / 425F.
2. Put the butter in the lid of a cast iron or enamel pot (or pie pan - you're looking for something about 25 cm / 10 inches wide with sides that will support the Dutch baby as it grows up and out in the oven). Put the pan in the oven and let the butter melt completely. Keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn.
3. Crack the three eggs into a blender and blend at a high speed for a minute.
4. Keep the blender whirling and pour in first the milk and then, gradually, the flour. Blend for another 30 seconds.
5. Remove the pan from oven and pour the Dutch baby batter into the pool of butter.
6. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately with lemon and sugar.
