When Cristina Onuta first entered [I Camisa & Son] (http://www.icamisa.co.uk/) in 1999, the shop still had sawdust on the floors — to prevent people from slipping after rain — and cured sausages dangling from the ceiling. While regulations have put an end to these trademarks, little else about the shop has changed since it opened in Soho in 1961.





At age 20, Cristina Onuta left Romania to take a six-month English course in London. Straight away, London felt like home. Cristina left the museum job that had sent her to London in the first place, and she found a part-time job at a flower shop and lots of new friends. One friend worked at [I Camisa & Son] (http://www.icamisa.co.uk/), an established Italian deli on Old Compton Street in Soho. After stopping by I Camisa to pick up her friend often enough that eventually the owners offered Cristina a job.
