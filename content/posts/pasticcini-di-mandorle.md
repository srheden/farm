I like to make notes in my cookbooks to remind myself of what went right and wrong with the recipe. *Lower heat next time. Don't forget the baking powder! Even better the day after.* After I've made a recipe a number of times or generally feel I've got the hang of it, I just put a tick beside the title. My pages of Rachel Roddy's [*Five Quarters: Recipes and Notes from A Kitchen in Rome*](http://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Rachel-Roddy/Five-Quarters--Recipes-and-Notes-from-a-Kitchen-in-Rome/17377993?gclid=CKWXptCa8NMCFcWw7QodiAoEGA) are full of tick marks and pasticcini di mandorle — soft almond biscuits — has six of them.

Besides the texture (crisp, dense, soft) and flavour of these lemony, marzipan-y biscuits, what delights me about them is how four basic ingredients come together so beautifully.  Until now, I've made them just as Rachel recommends, but recently an insufficient supply of almonds demanded I deviate by adding corn meal. A recipe substitution gone right! I've included the actual ingredients below, as well as my deviation in case any of you are short on almonds as well.

Ingredients:

* 350g ground almonds (or 200g ground almonds, 150g corn meal)
* 200g icing sugar (plus extra on a plate for dusting)
* the finely grated zest of a large unwaxed lemon
* 2 large eggs, beaten with a fork — keep aside the fork for combining the ingredients

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 180C/gas mark 4/350F and put a sheet of baking parchment on a baking tray.
2. In a large bowl, use the fork you beat the eggs with to combine the ground almonds, icing sugar, and lemon zest.
3. Add the eggs to the bowl and continue to mix with the fork until you get a sticky dough.
4. Rub some icing sugar between your palms. Grab a walnut-sized piece of dough and roll it between your hands to form a ball. Dust the ball with more sugar by rolling it on the plate of icing sugar. Place the ball on the prepared baking tray.
5. Use your thumb to indent the centre of each ball of dough.
6. Bake for about 20 minutes. Take the biscuits out when the icing sugar has crinkled and they're just beginning to colour on top.
7. Cool on a wire rack and cool before eating — or storing in an airtight container.
