If you find a finer selection of local and global produce in North London, let me know. I've found white asparagus, golden kiwis, purple yams, green almonds, and red gooseberries in Newington Green â€” and that's only the produce with colours in their names. The shop is always bustling, thus the turnover is high and the fruit and veg you come home with is always fresh.
