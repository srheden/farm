Two to three times a month I walk, tube, walk, run (through a pigeon-filled tunnel), and walk to [Puntarelle & Co] (https://puntarelle.co.uk/) (formally John & Elena Fruit & Veg). This takes me, round trip, about 2.5 hours, but I'm not complaining. For rarely more than a tenner, I come away with some of the best British and Italian produce you can buy in London.

Puntarelle & Co is open to the public on Saturdays, from early morning to around 2pm. In addition to the fresh produce, you can find lots of their own preserves, a selection of spices, nuts, pasta, and pulses there. They also share their arch with wonderful cheesemonger, KÃ¤seswiss, so what are you waiting for?
