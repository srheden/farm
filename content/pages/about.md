Hello! I'm Sarah Eden. Grocery Stories is about community and food. It started out mostly about grocery stores — places I've been interested ever since shopping and working at [a family-run Lebanese grocery store] (http://grocerystories.net/posts/a-grocery-story/) as a teenager — but then it grew because getting the ingredients is only the middle.

You'll find stories here about the people, shops, and food I love most, around London and in places I visit.
