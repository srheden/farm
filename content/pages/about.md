Hello. I'm Sarah Eden. Grocery Stories is about community and food. It started out mostly about grocery stores — places I've been interested ever since shopping at and working in [a family-run Lebanese grocery store] (http://grocerystories.net/places/a-grocery-story/) as a teenager — but then it grew because getting the ingredients is only the middle.

You'll find stories here about the people, stores, cafés, and restaurants I love most, in London and in places I visit. You will find recipes worth recreating. You'll also find information about food-related events I'm going to, have participated in the past, or wish I could attend.
