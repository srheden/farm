It's a Saturday in May. Find yourself in Portland, Oregon at the [PSU Farmers Market] (http://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/our-markets/psu/). Stop by [Groundwork Organics's] (https://www.groundworkorganics.com/) stall and, casting aside the umbrella you thought would be necessary for visiting this city, buy as many sugar snap peas as you can carry. Pick a tree to lean on and crack open the peas, delight at the snapping and occasional pea popping, and eat the pods whole.

A time may come when you feel like eating something other than sugar snap peas alone. The recipe below, adapted from Joshua McFadden and Martha Holmberg's cookbook [*Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables*] (https://www.amazon.com/Six-Seasons-New-Way-Vegetables/dp/1579656315), will take you just far enough away from the pod by itself with the surprising nuttiness of toasted mustard and cumin seeds and the refreshing combination of lemon and tarragon.


Ingredients:

* 500g sugar snap peas (strings pulled off, if needed)
* 1/4 cup lightly packed tarragon leaves
* 1/2 cup lightly packed flat leaf parsley leaves
* 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1/2 a large unwaxed lemon (finely grated zest and juice)
* salt and black pepper
* olive oil (to taste; approximately two tablespoons)
* optional garnish: chive blossom


Method:

1. Slice the sugar snap peas in half - or thinner if you like - at an angle. Move the prepared peas to a large serving bowl or platter and mix in the tarragon and parsley leaves.

2. Put the mustard seeds and cumin seeds in a small pan over medium heat. Shake the pan as the seeds toast, removing them once they become fragrant (approximately 3 minutes). Put the seeds in a medium bowl you'll use to prepare the dressing for the peas.

3. To the bowl with the seeds, add the juice and zest of half a lemon and salt, pepper, and olive oil (to taste). Mix, taste, and adjust the seasoning.

4. Toss the snap peas, tarragon, and parsley with the dressing. Garnish with chive blossom if desired and serve.
